# 🚀 60-Day AI Engineer Roadmap

Welcome to my journey to become an AI Engineer! This repository documents my progress through a comprehensive 60-day roadmap that combines AI/ML skills with job-readiness practices.

## 📋 Overview

This roadmap is designed to build a strong foundation in Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and deployment, while incorporating daily DSA practice and Git commits for portfolio development.

### Key Focus Areas:
- **AI/ML Skills**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, Hugging Face, Transformers
- **Job-Readiness**: DSA practice, Git commits, READMEs, portfolio polishing
- **Projects**: Hands-on implementations from data analysis to model deployment

## 📅 Roadmap Structure

The full 60-day plan is detailed in [`ROADMAP.MD`](./ROADMAP.MD). Here's a quick overview:

- **Week 1**: Python Foundations
- **Week 2**: Math Foundations
- **Week 3**: Core ML (Scikit-Learn)
- **Week 4**: Model Evaluation
- **Week 5**: Deep Learning Basics (PyTorch)
- **Week 6**: Advanced Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
- **Week 7**: Hugging Face & LLMs
- **Week 8**: Deployment & Portfolio
